# Ignite Timer

Ignite Timer is a web application that works like a Pomodoro timer, where we can set a countdown to accomplish a task. The application also stores a history of the timers performed.

It was created within Rocketseat's "Ignite" course with the purpose of learning about advanced React concepts such as context, reducer, forms, Typescript, accessing and writing to Local Storage and much more. In addition, libraries such as DateFNS, immer, React Hook Form, ZOD, React Router DOM, and others were used.

Ignite Timer is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed at: https://henriquemarcelo.github.io/ignite-timer/
